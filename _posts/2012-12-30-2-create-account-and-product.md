{:.steps}
### Register for an Amazon Developer Account

If this is your first time creating an AVS product, you'll need to be a registered **Amazon Developer**. Follow the instructions [here-UPDATE](https://developer.amazon.com/login.html) to create your free developer account. 


### Create your Prototype Product and Security Profile

Next, you'll need to create a **Product Profile** and **Security Profile** for your first AVS Prototype.  Follow the instructions [here-UPDATE](https://developer.amazon.com/login.html) to create your AVS Prototype.  

When you are ready to ship your commercial product, you'll name your Product how you'd like it to show up in the end-user's Alexa app.  If you're building a companion app, the **Security Profile Name** will be presented to the user when you are requesting consent to share information with your application - so you'll want to include your company name in there. 

Ensure that your **Product Name** and **Product ID** are registered as **"Prototype"** for this workshop.
